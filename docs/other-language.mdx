# For languages that do not have libraries

ThunLights OAuth can be used even in languages for which Team ThunLights has not provided a library.
In such cases, you will need to refer to the endpoint explanations in this document to create your own wrapper.

If you are considering creating a ThunLights OAuth library, please contact us via [official Twitter](https://twitter.com/thunlights).
We can take on the development for languages you plan to use in the future or are currently working on.

Even if Team ThunLights cannot assist directly, we can provide various support, such as notifying you of API updates. Please feel free to reach out to us.

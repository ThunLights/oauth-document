# Preparing What You Need for Development

**What is introduced here is the environment setup to execute the code described in this document.**
ThunLights Oauth can also be used with other languages and libraries.

## 1: Install Node.js / npm

Download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

For how to download, please select the environment that suits you from the select menu.

As of January 29, 2025, please be aware that the latest versions of Node.js (22 and 23) may be unstable in some environments. The development of ThunLights is done with Node.js v20.18.2. I hope this helps as a reference.

## 2: Install VScode

Please install VScode from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The default language setting for VScode is English, so I recommend Japanese users to install the [Japanese Language Pack extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-CEINTL.vscode-language-pack-ja).

## 3: Set Up the Development Environment

After installation, please add a folder as your workspace.

Then, execute the following commands to set up the environment:

```console
$ npm init -y
$ npm install typescript
$ npm install ts-node
$ npx tsc --init
```

Files such as package.json and tsconfig.json should have been generated.

As a final touch, create an index.ts file, and you are all set.

All the test code in this document can be written in index.ts, and you can execute it by running ts-node index.ts.
